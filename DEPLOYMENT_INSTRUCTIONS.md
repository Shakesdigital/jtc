# üöÄ DEPLOY YOUR SERMON SYSTEM - EASY STEPS

## ‚úÖ BUILD COMPLETE!
Your build folder is ready with all sermon files included (259MB audio + images).

---

## METHOD 1: Netlify Drag & Drop (EASIEST) ‚≠ê

### Step 1: Open Netlify
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Log in to your account

### Step 2: Drag & Drop
1. Find your **Sites** dashboard
2. Look for your existing site (jtc.shakesdigital.com or similar)
3. Click on the site
4. Go to **Deploys** tab
5. Scroll down and find the **"Need to update your site? Drag and drop your site output folder here"** box

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Open File Explorer on your computer
2. Navigate to: `D:\Jinja Town Church Work\JTCapp\build`
3. **DRAG the entire `build` folder** into the Netlify drop zone
4. Wait for upload (may take 5-10 minutes due to 259MB audio files)
5. Done! ‚úÖ

Your site will be live with all sermons working!

## METHOD 2: Netlify CLI (Alternative)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (one time only)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the build folder
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

---

## METHOD 3: GitHub Auto-Deploy

Since you already pushed to GitHub:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Click your site
3. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy**
4. Under **Build settings**, click **Edit settings**
5. Set:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Deploys** tab
8. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**

Netlify will pull from GitHub and build automatically!

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This may still timeout due to large files. Use Method 1 (Drag & Drop) instead.

---

## METHOD 4: Vercel (Alternative Platform)

If you're using Vercel instead:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

---

## üéØ AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Test your site:
1. Visit: your-site.com/sermons/archive
2. Click **Listen** on "Finding Your Soulmate"
3. Verify audio plays
4. Test download buttons
5. Check other sermons

---

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Upload Taking Too Long?
- The 259MB of audio may take 5-10 minutes
- Don't close the browser
- Wait for "Site is live" message

### Still Timing Out?
Use this alternative:
1. Remove audio from build: `rm -rf build/sermons/audio`
2. Deploy without audio first
3. Then use FTP to upload just the audio folder
