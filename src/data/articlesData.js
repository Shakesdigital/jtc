      <p>Devotion can easily be confused with commitment. But while devotion is a fruit and outworking of the Holy Spirit, commitment is the believer's response to this.</p>

      <p>To illustrate this, my perspective was challenged by a young man who shared on how he had finally come to understand devotion. He had been struggling in his faith for many years but just couldn't commit himself fully. Then one day, it was as if the light came on. He was convicted to read the Bible every day. That conviction to get up early to spend time reading and praying surely went against his natural desire to sleep in, but he surrendered to the conviction. As he continued in his commitment to this, it grew into a desire as he got to know Jesus personally and drew near to his Father God. As he continued to read the Word, he was increasingly convicted about certain areas of his life with which God was not pleased. He started to respond and act on each conviction, which in many instances went against his natural desires. Yes, he had a growing desire to follow Jesus and obey Him, but the conviction to do the right thing, even when it went against his desires, is what really revealed his growth in devotion to the Lord Jesus.</p>

      <p>For years we have learned and taught God's blueprint for building churches, as set out in Acts 2:42-47. The four values mentioned in this passage that were put into practice by the early church are foundational to wholesome church life and relationships. However, I have come to realise that we should be careful how we apply these four values as the standard of a healthy church.</p>

      <blockquote>But then the promised Holy Spirit was poured out on the 120 faithful followers of Jesus, and everything changed.</blockquote>

      <p>A few years back, a divinity student asked me whether I thought that this passage was descriptive or prescriptive, meaning either it is what happened in the early church or that this is how church should be done. I had to really think about this. His lecturer had told him that the passage was descriptive, though he was convinced it was prescriptive and what every church family should be like. As time has passed, I have become more convinced that the four values are descriptive of what was happening in the early church.</p>

      <p>To explain, in Acts 2 we witness an incredible miracle. Jesus had been preaching for three years, summed up in, 'Repent, for the kingdom of God is near' (Matthew 3:2). Though thousands had been following Him, few were actually committed to paying the price it would require. His closest friends ran away, betrayed Him and denied Him when he was crucified.</p>

      <p>This was the scene that set the stage for Acts 2. But then the promised Holy Spirit was poured out on the 120 faithful followers of Jesus, and everything changed. Once shy, fearful disciples became fearless, selfless preachers and testifiers of what they had witnessed, felt and touched. They preached 'Christ and Him crucified' and resurrected, repentance of sin and baptism, and that whoever accepted Christ and put their trust in Him would receive the Holy Spirit too.</p>

      <blockquote>So while Jesus does encourage His followers to look at the 'fruit a tree produces'…we must be careful not to use Acts 2 as our measuring stick</blockquote>

      <p>Three thousand were cut to the heart by the message, repented of their sins and put their trust in Jesus. The early church was born! "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer" (Acts 2:42). But where did their devotion result from? Not from the teaching or lifestyle of the apostles, but from a life-changing encounter with and infilling of the Holy Spirit! Jesus had promised that after He returned to His Father, He would ask His Father to send the Holy Spirit, who would not only be with His followers but in them.</p>

      <p>What we see in Acts 2:42-47 is the fruit of the work, presence and indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the new believers. What does this mean for us? What I have observed is that we as elders, church leaders and community leaders, can easily fall into the trap of making the four values of Acts 2 prescriptive of how church, and specifically the lives of individual believers, should be evaluated. We must be careful, however, that we don't use this passage to judge the lives of our church family. So while Jesus does encourage His followers to look at the 'fruit a tree produces' to recognise what type of tree it is, we must be careful not to use Acts 2 as our measuring stick, even though the passage does show us what the lives of Spirit-filled people looked like. It would be great if it were as easy as that, but don't we then run the risk of either becoming judgmental or religious? Should we not rather, first and foremost, lovingly draw those who we may have a concern about into a deeper devotion to Jesus and their heavenly Father? Should we not pray with them and for them, for a greater infilling and outflowing of the presence of the Holy Spirit in and through their lives?</p>

      <blockquote>Pressure to conform too often results in producing the opposite of what we as church leaders want to achieve.</blockquote>

      <p>Alternatively, we can give in to the temptation to judge them and deem that they do not have the Holy Spirit at all or are resisting and not surrendering to Him. To be sure, the Bible teaches us all to be in step with the Holy Spirit, and leaders should also take care to set the example of being in step with Him in this.</p>

      <p>So how should leaders respond when a young believer is still struggling with attending all the services and meetings of the church family? What if he isn't yet convicted to give his tithe, join a community or plug into any 'visual' ministry? How do we measure devotion? Jesus measured it rather simply in the following statement: "Are you following Me?" What we need to foster is relationship, and we as leaders can love those who are struggling into a growing commitment to 'plug in' without forgetting that there could well be issues that need to be resolved, healed or released in the person's life.</p>

      <p>The evidence of the indwelling Holy Spirit is a growing devotion to produce the values of Acts 2:42-47. It is and always must be a work and outflow of the Holy Spirit, not of any pressure or expectation of leadership or even church practice. If it is, a local church can easily put pressure on its members to perform outwardly, without a deep, inner conviction and desire fueled by a growing relationship and surrender to the Holy Spirit. Pressure to conform too often results in producing the opposite of what we as church leaders want to achieve.</p>

      <blockquote>Instead, we must draw others in with love and patience, encouraging them daily in their growth and devotion to Jesus.</blockquote>

      <p>Instead, we must draw others in with love and patience, encouraging them daily in their growth and devotion to Jesus. Surely this will produce either a desire or conviction to spend time with the church family and to get involved in the community of believers. We may then expect that other fruit will become evident in their lives as they are encouraged in their walk with Jesus.</p>

      <p>My conclusion is that Acts 2:42-47 is descriptive of the devotion in the early church resulting from the transformative encounter and subsequent indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in each believer. And we can experience the same in our personal lives and church family! We only have to remember that it is 'not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord' (Zechariah 4:6).</p>

      <p>22 years ago, Sue and I were part of a church plant in an African country, with the aim of providing a spiritual home for the European community in the capital city. While a worthy cause, we found out quickly that this goal carried numerous problems. Everyone involved had strong opinions about how the church, the leadership, the Sunday services etc., were to be formed and conducted, resulting in much disunity. After 31 years in Africa, the Lord called us back to the Netherlands to be part of another church plant.</p>

      <p>As we reflect on the values of a new church plant, establishing a family of believers and a community of faith, we have to hold the importance of unity in high regard and be careful not to undermine it. One of the ways unity can be eroded is through complaints and holding our opinions too highly.</p>

      <blockquote>The question must be asked: how much value do I attach to my opinion?</blockquote>

      <h2>Virus 'Experts'</h2>

      <p>When the Coronavirus was at its height, everyone suddenly became an expert on it: the cause, the hidden agenda, the impact, and where it fitted into the eschatological framework. The Internet was overflowing with opinions.</p>

      <p>There is, however, another dangerous virus. Opinions can be a virus that infects many with a 'complaining spirit of discontent'. Israel, in the desert, experienced the consequences of this, infecting thousands, and with fatal consequences. The question must be asked: how much value do I attach to my opinion?</p>

      <h2>God's Chosen Leaders</h2>

      <p>The Bible shows us that the Lord appoints and raises up leaders for His people and His church. God's leadership structure is not based on democracy and people's opinions but on His sovereign choice! The unity God longs for, and for which Jesus was willing to die, is 'that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me' (John 17:21, ESV).</p>

      <p>A Biblical event highlighting the danger of opinion-spouting is found in Numbers 12:1-9: 'Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife… 'Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?' they asked. 'Hasn't he also spoken through us?' And the Lord heard this. (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, 'Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.' So the three of them went out. Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, he said, 'Listen to my words: 'When there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams. But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?' The anger of the Lord burned against them, and he left them.' (NIV)</p>

      <h3>What was happening here?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Miriam and Aaron used Moses' marriage to Zipporah, a non-Israelite woman, as a pretext to spout their opinion. 'Aren't we just as good as you, Moses? Don't you think we know better than you, after all we went through in Egypt?'</li>
        <li>Moses was their little brother. Raised in the comfort of the Egyptian royal palace, Moses had run away when confronted with the hardship of slavery in Egypt. But Miriam and Aaron had stayed! It is clear that only God's opinion carried weight, not Miriam and Aaron's. Moses was His choice. Though not perfect or without fault, the passage tells us that he was a humble leader (quote likely added at a later time).</li>
        <li>Elders are also God's choice to lead His church within each local faith family. Do we trust that the Lord leads the apostolic team to appoint elders under His direction and that He will lead them with His Holy Spirit?</li>
        <li>Miriam and Aaron's opinionated assault on Moses was an assault on God's choice. As a result Miriam, who instigated this assault, got infected with leprosy and had to be isolated from infecting the community for seven days. Sharing your observations or concerns with your elders is welcomed and encouraged, but doing this in an inflexible and opinionated manner is wrong. Always check your motivation. Miriam's was one of jealousy and unbelief. Ultimately, she did not trust God and His choice. We ought to take heed of this event, especially what our Lord feels about opinion-pushers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Grumbling and Arguing</h2>

      <p>Let's also take heed of the following exhortation: 'Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, 'children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.' Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life' (Philippians 2:14-15, NIV).</p>

      <p>We sure know how to grumble and complain, and some of us are experts in it. We complain about the weather, political leaders and, not to forget, our church. If you are doing this, you aren't presenting yourself to the world as a child of God – pure and blameless in a warped and crooked generation. We need to be light-bearers, not hypocrites. Will your elders and community leaders be able to glory in you when Jesus comes back?</p>

      <blockquote>You shall have no other gods before me</blockquote>

      <h2>Has Your Opinion Become an Idol?</h2>

      <p>Let's carefully contemplate this question in light of the first commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me' (Exodus 20:3). We all know this command and our immediate response may be, 'Surely I am not guilty of this? Surely I am not making an idol?' But keep in mind that our opinion can be like a virus – when left to fester, it spreads and brings about much destruction.</p>

      <h3>Reflection: What is your honest opinion about the following?</h3>

      <p>Test your heart and be honest as you answer:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The length of a Sunday service</li>
        <li>The chosen worship songs or leader</li>
        <li>The sermon – too long, too short, too much, too difficult, boring, heard it before</li>
        <li>The children – too busy, too noisy</li>
        <li>The coffee – too little, too weak, too strong, too hot/cold, cups too small</li>
        <li>The leadership/elders of your church</li>
        <li>Your fellow believers</li>
        <li>The community group make-up</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Antidote</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Be thankful, '…do everything you do in the name of Jesus, thanking God the Father through Him.' (Colossians 3:15-17, NIV)</li>
        <li>Be humble. You can share your opinion, but it is your opinion and not necessarily the truth. (Philippians 2:4-9)</li>
        <li>Confess your pride. Repent of idolatry. (1 John 1:8-9)</li>
        <li>Die to yourself and any cherished opinions. (Romans 8:13)</li>
        <li>Be merciful towards one another.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ask yourself: does voicing my opinion</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>break down or edify?</li>
        <li>build up the church?</li>
        <li>build up my brother or sister?</li>
        <li>build up my leaders (or myself)?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If it is not edifying, if it breaks down, you should rather keep your opinions to yourself. Is it your opinion, your criticism, or is it based on the truth?</p>

      <blockquote>Everyone's opinion was given too much attention and the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Bible slowly faded away.</blockquote>

      <p>If we do not decisively settle the urge to push our opinions, the same thing may happen as did to the church plant we were in. Everyone's opinion was given too much attention and the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Bible slowly faded away. It became a church community that tolerated and compromised on everything and, eventually, it brought separation.</p>

      <p>If the Lord has convicted you of being too strong with your opinions and you want to change, be quick to confess your sins, repent and turn away from this. Let us be careful not to make our opinions an idol.</p>
