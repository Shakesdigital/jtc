      <p>Devotion can easily be confused with commitment. But while devotion is a fruit and outworking of the Holy Spirit, commitment is the believer's response to this.</p>

      <p>To illustrate this, my perspective was challenged by a young man who shared on how he had finally come to understand devotion. He had been struggling in his faith for many years but just couldn't commit himself fully. Then one day, it was as if the light came on. He was convicted to read the Bible every day. That conviction to get up early to spend time reading and praying surely went against his natural desire to sleep in, but he surrendered to the conviction. As he continued in his commitment to this, it grew into a desire as he got to know Jesus personally and drew near to his Father God. As he continued to read the Word, he was increasingly convicted about certain areas of his life with which God was not pleased. He started to respond and act on each conviction, which in many instances went against his natural desires. Yes, he had a growing desire to follow Jesus and obey Him, but the conviction to do the right thing, even when it went against his desires, is what really revealed his growth in devotion to the Lord Jesus.</p>

      <p>For years we have learned and taught God's blueprint for building churches, as set out in Acts 2:42-47. The four values mentioned in this passage that were put into practice by the early church are foundational to wholesome church life and relationships. However, I have come to realise that we should be careful how we apply these four values as the standard of a healthy church.</p>

      <blockquote>But then the promised Holy Spirit was poured out on the 120 faithful followers of Jesus, and everything changed.</blockquote>

      <p>A few years back, a divinity student asked me whether I thought that this passage was descriptive or prescriptive, meaning either it is what happened in the early church or that this is how church should be done. I had to really think about this. His lecturer had told him that the passage was descriptive, though he was convinced it was prescriptive and what every church family should be like. As time has passed, I have become more convinced that the four values are descriptive of what was happening in the early church.</p>

      <p>To explain, in Acts 2 we witness an incredible miracle. Jesus had been preaching for three years, summed up in, 'Repent, for the kingdom of God is near' (Matthew 3:2). Though thousands had been following Him, few were actually committed to paying the price it would require. His closest friends ran away, betrayed Him and denied Him when he was crucified.</p>

      <p>This was the scene that set the stage for Acts 2. But then the promised Holy Spirit was poured out on the 120 faithful followers of Jesus, and everything changed. Once shy, fearful disciples became fearless, selfless preachers and testifiers of what they had witnessed, felt and touched. They preached 'Christ and Him crucified' and resurrected, repentance of sin and baptism, and that whoever accepted Christ and put their trust in Him would receive the Holy Spirit too.</p>

      <blockquote>So while Jesus does encourage His followers to look at the 'fruit a tree produces'…we must be careful not to use Acts 2 as our measuring stick</blockquote>

      <p>Three thousand were cut to the heart by the message, repented of their sins and put their trust in Jesus. The early church was born! "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer" (Acts 2:42). But where did their devotion result from? Not from the teaching or lifestyle of the apostles, but from a life-changing encounter with and infilling of the Holy Spirit! Jesus had promised that after He returned to His Father, He would ask His Father to send the Holy Spirit, who would not only be with His followers but in them.</p>

      <p>What we see in Acts 2:42-47 is the fruit of the work, presence and indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the new believers. What does this mean for us? What I have observed is that we as elders, church leaders and community leaders, can easily fall into the trap of making the four values of Acts 2 prescriptive of how church, and specifically the lives of individual believers, should be evaluated. We must be careful, however, that we don't use this passage to judge the lives of our church family. So while Jesus does encourage His followers to look at the 'fruit a tree produces' to recognise what type of tree it is, we must be careful not to use Acts 2 as our measuring stick, even though the passage does show us what the lives of Spirit-filled people looked like. It would be great if it were as easy as that, but don't we then run the risk of either becoming judgmental or religious? Should we not rather, first and foremost, lovingly draw those who we may have a concern about into a deeper devotion to Jesus and their heavenly Father? Should we not pray with them and for them, for a greater infilling and outflowing of the presence of the Holy Spirit in and through their lives?</p>

      <blockquote>Pressure to conform too often results in producing the opposite of what we as church leaders want to achieve.</blockquote>

      <p>Alternatively, we can give in to the temptation to judge them and deem that they do not have the Holy Spirit at all or are resisting and not surrendering to Him. To be sure, the Bible teaches us all to be in step with the Holy Spirit, and leaders should also take care to set the example of being in step with Him in this.</p>

      <p>So how should leaders respond when a young believer is still struggling with attending all the services and meetings of the church family? What if he isn't yet convicted to give his tithe, join a community or plug into any 'visual' ministry? How do we measure devotion? Jesus measured it rather simply in the following statement: "Are you following Me?" What we need to foster is relationship, and we as leaders can love those who are struggling into a growing commitment to 'plug in' without forgetting that there could well be issues that need to be resolved, healed or released in the person's life.</p>

      <p>The evidence of the indwelling Holy Spirit is a growing devotion to produce the values of Acts 2:42-47. It is and always must be a work and outflow of the Holy Spirit, not of any pressure or expectation of leadership or even church practice. If it is, a local church can easily put pressure on its members to perform outwardly, without a deep, inner conviction and desire fueled by a growing relationship and surrender to the Holy Spirit. Pressure to conform too often results in producing the opposite of what we as church leaders want to achieve.</p>

      <blockquote>Instead, we must draw others in with love and patience, encouraging them daily in their growth and devotion to Jesus.</blockquote>

      <p>Instead, we must draw others in with love and patience, encouraging them daily in their growth and devotion to Jesus. Surely this will produce either a desire or conviction to spend time with the church family and to get involved in the community of believers. We may then expect that other fruit will become evident in their lives as they are encouraged in their walk with Jesus.</p>

      <p>My conclusion is that Acts 2:42-47 is descriptive of the devotion in the early church resulting from the transformative encounter and subsequent indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in each believer. And we can experience the same in our personal lives and church family! We only have to remember that it is 'not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord' (Zechariah 4:6).</p>

    content: `
      <p>22 years ago, Sue and I were part of a church plant in an African country, with the aim of providing a spiritual home for the European community in the capital city. While a worthy cause, we found out quickly that this goal carried numerous problems. Everyone involved had strong opinions about how the church, the leadership, the Sunday services etc., were to be formed and conducted, resulting in much disunity. After 31 years in Africa, the Lord called us back to the Netherlands to be part of another church plant.</p>

      <p>As we reflect on the values of a new church plant, establishing a family of believers and a community of faith, we have to hold the importance of unity in high regard and be careful not to undermine it. One of the ways unity can be eroded is through complaints and holding our opinions too highly.</p>

      <blockquote>The question must be asked: how much value do I attach to my opinion?</blockquote>

      <h2>Virus 'Experts'</h2>

      <p>When the Coronavirus was at its height, everyone suddenly became an expert on it: the cause, the hidden agenda, the impact, and where it fitted into the eschatological framework. The Internet was overflowing with opinions.</p>

      <p>There is, however, another dangerous virus. Opinions can be a virus that infects many with a 'complaining spirit of discontent'. Israel, in the desert, experienced the consequences of this, infecting thousands, and with fatal consequences. The question must be asked: how much value do I attach to my opinion?</p>

      <h2>God's Chosen Leaders</h2>

      <p>The Bible shows us that the Lord appoints and raises up leaders for His people and His church. God's leadership structure is not based on democracy and people's opinions but on His sovereign choice! The unity God longs for, and for which Jesus was willing to die, is 'that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me' (John 17:21, ESV).</p>

      <p>A Biblical event highlighting the danger of opinion-spouting is found in Numbers 12:1-9: 'Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife… 'Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?' they asked. 'Hasn't he also spoken through us?' And the Lord heard this. (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, 'Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.' So the three of them went out. Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, he said, 'Listen to my words: 'When there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams. But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?' The anger of the Lord burned against them, and he left them.' (NIV)</p>

      <h3>What was happening here?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Miriam and Aaron used Moses' marriage to Zipporah, a non-Israelite woman, as a pretext to spout their opinion. 'Aren't we just as good as you, Moses? Don't you think we know better than you, after all we went through in Egypt?'</li>
        <li>Moses was their little brother. Raised in the comfort of the Egyptian royal palace, Moses had run away when confronted with the hardship of slavery in Egypt. But Miriam and Aaron had stayed! It is clear that only God's opinion carried weight, not Miriam and Aaron's. Moses was His choice. Though not perfect or without fault, the passage tells us that he was a humble leader (quote likely added at a later time).</li>
        <li>Elders are also God's choice to lead His church within each local faith family. Do we trust that the Lord leads the apostolic team to appoint elders under His direction and that He will lead them with His Holy Spirit?</li>
        <li>Miriam and Aaron's opinionated assault on Moses was an assault on God's choice. As a result Miriam, who instigated this assault, got infected with leprosy and had to be isolated from infecting the community for seven days. Sharing your observations or concerns with your elders is welcomed and encouraged, but doing this in an inflexible and opinionated manner is wrong. Always check your motivation. Miriam's was one of jealousy and unbelief. Ultimately, she did not trust God and His choice. We ought to take heed of this event, especially what our Lord feels about opinion-pushers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Grumbling and Arguing</h2>

      <p>Let's also take heed of the following exhortation: 'Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, 'children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.' Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life' (Philippians 2:14-15, NIV).</p>

      <p>We sure know how to grumble and complain, and some of us are experts in it. We complain about the weather, political leaders and, not to forget, our church. If you are doing this, you aren't presenting yourself to the world as a child of God – pure and blameless in a warped and crooked generation. We need to be light-bearers, not hypocrites. Will your elders and community leaders be able to glory in you when Jesus comes back?</p>

      <blockquote>You shall have no other gods before me</blockquote>

      <h2>Has Your Opinion Become an Idol?</h2>

      <p>Let's carefully contemplate this question in light of the first commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me' (Exodus 20:3). We all know this command and our immediate response may be, 'Surely I am not guilty of this? Surely I am not making an idol?' But keep in mind that our opinion can be like a virus – when left to fester, it spreads and brings about much destruction.</p>

      <h3>Reflection: What is your honest opinion about the following?</h3>

      <p>Test your heart and be honest as you answer:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The length of a Sunday service</li>
        <li>The chosen worship songs or leader</li>
        <li>The sermon – too long, too short, too much, too difficult, boring, heard it before</li>
        <li>The children – too busy, too noisy</li>
        <li>The coffee – too little, too weak, too strong, too hot/cold, cups too small</li>
        <li>The leadership/elders of your church</li>
        <li>Your fellow believers</li>
        <li>The community group make-up</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Antidote</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Be thankful, '…do everything you do in the name of Jesus, thanking God the Father through Him.' (Colossians 3:15-17, NIV)</li>
        <li>Be humble. You can share your opinion, but it is your opinion and not necessarily the truth. (Philippians 2:4-9)</li>
        <li>Confess your pride. Repent of idolatry. (1 John 1:8-9)</li>
        <li>Die to yourself and any cherished opinions. (Romans 8:13)</li>
        <li>Be merciful towards one another.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ask yourself: does voicing my opinion</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>break down or edify?</li>
        <li>build up the church?</li>
        <li>build up my brother or sister?</li>
        <li>build up my leaders (or myself)?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If it is not edifying, if it breaks down, you should rather keep your opinions to yourself. Is it your opinion, your criticism, or is it based on the truth?</p>

      <blockquote>Everyone's opinion was given too much attention and the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Bible slowly faded away.</blockquote>

      <p>If we do not decisively settle the urge to push our opinions, the same thing may happen as did to the church plant we were in. Everyone's opinion was given too much attention and the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Bible slowly faded away. It became a church community that tolerated and compromised on everything and, eventually, it brought separation.</p>

      <p>If the Lord has convicted you of being too strong with your opinions and you want to change, be quick to confess your sins, repent and turn away from this. Let us be careful not to make our opinions an idol.</p>

    content: `
      <p>The question of baptism - whether by immersion (dunking) or sprinkling - has been debated in Christian circles for centuries. To find clarity, we must return to Scripture and examine what the Bible teaches about this important practice.</p>

      <h2>The Biblical Meaning of Baptism</h2>
      <p>The Greek word "baptizo" (βαπτίζω) used in the New Testament literally means "to immerse," "to submerge," or "to dip." This word was commonly used in ancient Greek literature to describe the complete immersion of objects in liquid, such as dyeing cloth where the fabric was fully immersed in dye.</p>

      <p>When the New Testament writers chose this specific word to describe Christian baptism, they were conveying a clear image - complete immersion in water, not mere sprinkling.</p>

      <h2>Jesus' Example</h2>
      <p>When we examine Jesus' baptism, we see the pattern clearly established. Matthew 3:16 tells us, "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water." The phrase "out of the water" strongly suggests that Jesus was in the water, not merely having water sprinkled on Him.</p>

      <p>Mark's account is even more explicit: "Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove" (Mark 1:10). This language clearly indicates immersion rather than sprinkling.</p>

      <h2>The Symbolism of Baptism</h2>
      <p>Paul explains the deeper theological meaning of baptism in Romans 6:3-4: "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."</p>

      <p>The symbolism is profound and clear:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Going under the water</strong> represents our death to sin and burial with Christ</li>
        <li><strong>Coming up from the water</strong> represents our resurrection to new life in Christ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This powerful symbolism is most fully expressed through complete immersion, which visually demonstrates the believer's identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection.</p>

      <h2>New Testament Examples</h2>
      <p>Throughout the New Testament, we find consistent examples supporting immersion:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch:</strong> "Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water..." (Acts 8:38-39). The text specifically mentions going down into the water and coming up out of it.</li>
        <li><strong>John's baptisms:</strong> John chose to baptize in the Jordan River and at Aenon near Salim "because there was plenty of water there" (John 3:23). If sprinkling were the method, a small amount of water would have sufficed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Historical Church Practice</h2>
      <p>Early church history supports immersion as the normative practice. The Didache, an early Christian document from the late first or early second century, describes baptism in "living water" (flowing water like rivers) and instructs believers to go down into the water.</p>

      <p>Archaeological evidence from ancient baptisteries shows they were constructed as pools deep enough for adults to stand in, designed specifically for baptism by immersion.</p>

      <h2>Addressing Common Questions</h2>
      <p>Some point to instances like the Philippian jailer (Acts 16:33) or Cornelius' household (Acts 10:47-48) as possible examples where sprinkling might have occurred. However:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>These accounts don't specify the exact method used</li>
        <li>The absence of detail in these passages doesn't negate the clear pattern established elsewhere in Scripture</li>
        <li>The consistent testimony of Scripture, the meaning of the Greek word, and early church practice all point to immersion</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Heart of the Matter</h2>
      <p>While understanding the biblical method is important, we must remember that baptism is fundamentally an act of obedience to Christ's command (Matthew 28:19) and a public declaration of faith in Him. It's an outward sign of an inward reality - the transformation that has occurred in the believer's heart.</p>

      <p>However, if we desire to follow the biblical pattern as faithfully as possible, the evidence clearly points to baptism by immersion as the New Testament norm and the method that best represents the theological truths baptism symbolizes.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Based on the biblical evidence - the meaning of the Greek word baptizo, Jesus' example, the symbolism Paul describes, the consistent pattern in New Testament accounts, and early church practice - baptism by immersion (dunking) appears to be the biblical method.</p>

      <p>This doesn't diminish the sincere faith of those who have been baptized differently, but it does call us to consider carefully following the biblical pattern in our obedience to Christ. As we seek to honor God in all we do, let us approach baptism with reverence, understanding both its rich symbolic meaning and its biblical method.</p>

      <p><em>May we submit to baptism as Jesus did, following His example and obeying His command, as we publicly declare our faith in Him and our identification with His death, burial, and resurrection.</em></p>

    excerpt: "Why is the family unit worth fighting for, and what is at stake? Understanding God's heart for family.",
    image: "/images/articles/IsFamilyGodsDesign_WebHeader.jpg",
    pdfUrl: "/articles/richard-four12-global/is Family God's Design.pdf",
    content: `
      <p>In our rapidly changing world, the traditional family unit is under unprecedented attack. Cultural voices question whether the family structure as we've known it is necessary, beneficial, or even desirable. As Christians, we must ask: Is family God's design? And if so, why is it worth defending?</p>

      <h2>God's Original Design</h2>
      <p>From the very beginning, God established the family as the foundational unit of human society. In Genesis 1:27-28, we read: "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.'"</p>

      <p>This wasn't merely a biological directive but a divine design for human flourishing. God created family as the context for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intimate companionship and mutual support</li>
        <li>Procreation and the nurturing of children</li>
        <li>Passing on values, faith, and wisdom to the next generation</li>
        <li>Providing stability and identity in society</li>
        <li>Reflecting God's own relational nature</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Foundation of Society</h2>
      <p>Throughout history and across cultures, the family has proven to be the fundamental building block of society. When families are strong, communities thrive. When families break down, societies struggle with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Increased poverty and economic instability</li>
        <li>Higher rates of crime and delinquency</li>
        <li>Mental health challenges and substance abuse</li>
        <li>Educational difficulties and reduced opportunities</li>
        <li>Breakdown of social cohesion and shared values</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Research consistently shows that children raised in stable, two-parent families generally experience better outcomes in education, health, emotional well-being, and future relationships. This isn't to condemn single parents who often do heroic work, but to affirm the wisdom of God's design.</p>

      <h2>The Attack on Family</h2>
      <p>Today's culture increasingly promotes ideologies that undermine the traditional family:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Radical individualism</strong> that prioritizes personal fulfillment over family commitment</li>
        <li><strong>Redefinition of marriage</strong> that departs from God's created order</li>
        <li><strong>Devaluation of parenthood</strong> in favor of career and personal pursuits</li>
        <li><strong>Confusion about gender</strong> that denies biological and biblical reality</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization of family breakdown</strong> through easy divorce and cohabitation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These trends aren't merely cultural shifts; they represent a fundamental rejection of God's design and wisdom. The consequences are already visible in broken lives, confused children, and fragmenting communities.</p>

      <h2>God's Heart for Family</h2>
      <p>God's design for family reflects His own nature and purposes:</p>

      <h3>1. Family as a Picture of the Gospel</h3>
      <p>The relationship between husband and wife is designed to reflect Christ's relationship with His church (Ephesians 5:25-32). Marriage is meant to be a living illustration of sacrificial love, faithful commitment, and joyful unity.</p>

      <h3>2. Family as the Primary Discipleship Context</h3>
      <p>God commanded parents to teach their children diligently about Him (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). The family is the primary place where faith is nurtured, biblical values are instilled, and children learn to know and love God.</p>

      <h3>3. Family as a Source of Identity and Belonging</h3>
      <p>In a world of isolation and loneliness, family provides deep bonds of love, acceptance, and belonging. God designed us for relationship, and family is the first and most foundational expression of that design.</p>

      <h3>4. Family as a Means of Blessing Generations</h3>
      <p>God's blessings and promises often extend through family lines (Genesis 17:7). Faithful families become channels of God's grace to future generations, creating a legacy of faith and righteousness.</p>

      <h2>Worth Fighting For</h2>
      <p>Given the divine origin and crucial importance of family, it's absolutely worth defending and fighting for. This means:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritizing our own marriages and families</strong> - Investing time, energy, and resources in building strong family relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Teaching biblical truth about family</strong> - Helping the next generation understand God's design</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting struggling families</strong> - Offering practical help, encouragement, and prayer</li>
        <li><strong>Standing for truth in the public square</strong> - Respectfully but firmly advocating for policies that strengthen families</li>
        <li><strong>Living out healthy family life</strong> - Being a positive example of what God-honoring families look like</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hope and Restoration</h2>
      <p>Even when families have been broken by sin, dysfunction, or tragedy, God offers hope and healing. Through Christ, broken relationships can be restored, wounds can be healed, and new patterns can be established. The gospel brings redemption not only to individuals but also to families.</p>

      <p>For those who come from broken families or struggle in their own family relationships, God promises to be "a father to the fatherless" (Psalm 68:5) and to set the lonely in families (Psalm 68:6). The church becomes a family for those who lack earthly family support.</p>

      <h2>What's at Stake?</h2>
      <p>The stakes in this battle for family couldn't be higher:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The well-being of our children and grandchildren</li>
        <li>The stability and health of our society</li>
        <li>The effective transmission of faith to the next generation</li>
        <li>The witness of the church to God's design and goodness</li>
        <li>The flourishing of individuals in the way God intended</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Yes, family is absolutely God's design - a beautiful, wise, and essential design for human flourishing. While our culture may reject or redefine family, we must hold fast to biblical truth, live it out with conviction and grace, and fight for the preservation and strengthening of families in our churches and communities.</p>

      <p>The family is worth fighting for because God designed it, children need it, society depends on it, and generations yet unborn will be affected by whether we defend it today.</p>

      <p><em>Let us commit ourselves to honoring God's design for family, strengthening our own families, and standing for truth in a confused world. The family is not just worth fighting for - it's essential to fight for.</em></p>

      <p>Every Christian will face times when their faith is tested. The question is not if trials will come, but when - and whether our faith will stand firm when they do. Peter wrote, "These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold" (1 Peter 1:7). Can your faith stand the test?</p>

      <h2>Why Does God Test Our Faith?</h2>
      <p>The testing of faith isn't about God discovering what's in our hearts - He already knows. Rather, testing serves several crucial purposes:</p>

      <h3>1. To Prove the Genuineness of Our Faith</h3>
      <p>Just as gold is tested by fire to prove its purity, our faith is tested to demonstrate its authenticity. James 1:2-4 says, "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."</p>

      <h3>2. To Strengthen and Mature Us</h3>
      <p>Trials aren't meant to destroy us but to develop us. Like a muscle that grows stronger through resistance, our faith becomes more robust through testing. Romans 5:3-4 explains: "We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."</p>

      <h3>3. To Purify Our Hearts</h3>
      <p>Testing reveals and removes impurities in our faith - false motives, misplaced trust, hidden sins, and weak foundations. This purification process, though painful, makes our faith more genuine and our relationship with God more authentic.</p>

      <h3>4. To Increase Our Dependence on God</h3>
      <p>When trials exceed our ability to cope, we're driven to deeper reliance on God. Paul wrote about his own trial: "We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself... But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God" (2 Corinthians 1:8-9).</p>

      <h2>Types of Tests We Face</h2>
      <p>The tests of faith come in various forms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suffering and hardship</strong> - Physical illness, financial difficulty, loss, persecution</li>
        <li><strong>Temptation</strong> - Enticements to sin, compromise, or abandon our convictions</li>
        <li><strong>Doubt and confusion</strong> - Questions about God's goodness, presence, or promises</li>
        <li><strong>Delay and waiting</strong> - Unanswered prayers, unfulfilled promises, prolonged difficulties</li>
        <li><strong>Opposition and rejection</strong> - Hostility from others because of our faith</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritual dryness</strong> - Seasons when God seems distant or silent</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Makes Faith Stand or Fall?</h2>
      <p>The difference between faith that endures and faith that fails lies in its foundation and characteristics:</p>

      <h3>Faith That Stands is Built on the Right Foundation</h3>
      <p>Jesus told the parable of two builders (Matthew 7:24-27). Both built houses that looked similar, but when storms came, only the house built on rock remained standing. Faith built on the solid rock of God's Word, not on feelings, circumstances, or human wisdom, will endure any test.</p>

      <h3>Faith That Stands is Rooted in Relationship</h3>
      <p>Knowing about God and knowing God are vastly different. Deep, personal relationship with God provides the anchor that holds when storms rage. Job could endure unimaginable suffering because he knew God personally: "Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him" (Job 13:15).</p>

      <h3>Faith That Stands is Fed and Nurtured</h3>
      <p>Faith requires regular nourishment through prayer, Scripture reading, worship, and fellowship. Neglected faith withers; cultivated faith flourishes. We must "fight the good fight of the faith" (1 Timothy 6:12), actively engaging in spiritual disciplines that strengthen us.</p>

      <h3>Faith That Stands Remembers God's Faithfulness</h3>
      <p>The Psalms repeatedly call us to remember what God has done. When David faced Goliath, he recalled how God had delivered him from the lion and bear (1 Samuel 17:37). Remembering God's past faithfulness gives confidence for present trials.</p>

      <h2>How to Prepare for Testing</h2>
      <p>We can't avoid tests, but we can prepare for them:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Build your foundation now</strong> - Don't wait for crisis to develop your relationship with God and knowledge of His Word</li>
        <li><strong>Cultivate daily disciplines</strong> - Regular prayer, Bible reading, and worship create spiritual strength</li>
        <li><strong>Stay connected to Christian community</strong> - We need fellow believers to encourage, support, and strengthen us</li>
        <li><strong>Deal with sin quickly</strong> - Unrepented sin weakens faith and hinders our relationship with God</li>
        <li><strong>Develop biblical perspective</strong> - Learn to see trials as opportunities for growth rather than just obstacles to endure</li>
        <li><strong>Practice gratitude and worship</strong> - Cultivating a thankful heart prepares us to worship even in difficulty</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Standing Firm in the Test</h2>
      <p>When testing comes, remember these truths:</p>

      <blockquote>God is sovereign - Nothing touches your life without His permission and purpose (Job 1:12; Romans 8:28)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>God is good - Even when circumstances are bad, God's character never changes (James 1:17)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>God is present - He promises never to leave or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>God is faithful - He will not allow us to be tested beyond what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>God has a purpose - Every test has divine purpose for our good and His glory (1 Peter 1:6-7)</blockquote>

      <h2>The Example of Christ</h2>
      <p>Jesus himself was "tempted in every way, just as we are - yet he was without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He endured the ultimate test - the cross - trusting in His Father's plan and purpose. Because He stood firm, we can look to Him for strength when our faith is tested.</p>

      <p>Hebrews 12:2-3 encourages us: "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."</p>

      <h2>The Reward of Tested Faith</h2>
      <p>Faith that endures testing receives great reward:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deeper intimacy with God</strong> - Trials drive us closer to Him</li>
        <li><strong>Greater spiritual maturity</strong> - We become more like Christ through suffering</li>
        <li><strong>Increased effectiveness</strong> - Tested faith can minister to others facing similar trials</li>
        <li><strong>Eternal reward</strong> - "Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life" (James 1:12)</li>
        <li><strong>Proven character</strong> - We gain confidence knowing our faith is real and resilient</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>So, can your faith stand the test? The answer depends not on the strength of your faith but on the object of your faith. A small faith in a great God will endure when great faith in a small god will fail.</p>

      <p>Build your life on the unshakeable foundation of Christ. Cultivate deep relationship with God through His Word and prayer. Stay connected to His people. When testing comes - and it will - stand firm, knowing that God is using even the hardest trials to refine your faith and make you more like Jesus.</p>

      <p><em>May we be found faithful when tested, standing firm on the Rock of our salvation, trusting in God's goodness and purpose even when we cannot see the way forward. Our faith will stand because He is faithful, and He who began a good work in us will carry it on to completion.</em></p>

    content: `
      <p>We live in a time of intense cultural conflict. Traditional values are challenged, biblical truths are dismissed, and Christians increasingly find themselves at odds with mainstream culture. This isn't merely a disagreement about preferences - it's a fundamental clash of worldviews. How should Christians understand and engage in this cultural war?</p>

      <h2>Understanding the Battle</h2>
      <p>The Apostle Paul reminded the Ephesian church: "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Ephesians 6:12).</p>

      <p>The cultural battles we see - over marriage, gender, life, religious freedom, and morality - are manifestations of a deeper spiritual conflict. Behind the human arguments and political debates lies a cosmic struggle between truth and deception, light and darkness, God's kingdom and the kingdom of this world.</p>

      <h2>The Changing Cultural Landscape</h2>
      <p>Western culture has undergone a dramatic shift in recent decades:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>From Judeo-Christian foundation to secular humanism</strong> - The biblical worldview that shaped Western civilization is being systematically replaced by a worldview that rejects God and places humanity at the center</li>
        <li><strong>From objective truth to subjective feelings</strong> - "Your truth" and "my truth" have replaced "the truth," and feelings are elevated above facts</li>
        <li><strong>From moral absolutes to moral relativism</strong> - What was once universally considered right or wrong is now dismissed as merely personal or cultural preference</li>
        <li><strong>From religious freedom to religious restriction</strong> - Freedom to practice faith is increasingly limited to private belief, not public expression</li>
        <li><strong>From complementary genders to gender confusion</strong> - The biblical understanding of male and female is rejected in favor of fluid, self-determined identities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Cultural Battlegrounds</h2>

      <h3>1. The Sanctity of Life</h3>
      <p>Our culture increasingly devalues human life - from abortion on demand to euthanasia. The biblical truth that every human is created in God's image (Genesis 1:27) and has inherent dignity and worth is rejected in favor of utilitarian calculations about quality of life or personal choice.</p>

      <h3>2. Marriage and Family</h3>
      <p>God's design for marriage as a lifelong covenant between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24) is ridiculed as outdated. Alternative family structures are promoted as equally valid, and those who hold to biblical teaching are labeled as hateful or discriminatory.</p>

      <h3>3. Gender and Sexuality</h3>
      <p>The confusion about gender identity and sexual ethics represents perhaps the most visible cultural battlefield. Biblical teaching about gender as God-given and sexuality as designed for marriage is rejected as oppressive, while biological reality is denied in favor of subjective feelings.</p>

      <h3>4. Religious Freedom</h3>
      <p>The right to live according to one's religious convictions is under attack. Christian business owners, teachers, healthcare workers, and others face increasing pressure to violate their conscience or face punishment.</p>

      <h3>5. Truth and Reality</h3>
      <p>The very concept of objective truth is questioned. The biblical claim that Jesus is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6) is dismissed as intolerant. Instead, truth is seen as whatever each person decides it to be.</p>

      <h2>The Christian Response</h2>
      <p>How should Christians engage in this cultural war? We must avoid two extremes:</p>

      <h3>The Extremes to Avoid</h3>

      <p><strong>1. Aggressive Combativeness</strong> - Some Christians respond with anger, harshness, and political warfare, forgetting that "our struggle is not against flesh and blood." This approach may win arguments but loses hearts and dishonors Christ.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Passive Accommodation</strong> - Others retreat from cultural engagement entirely or compromise biblical truth to gain cultural acceptance. This approach may gain temporary approval but abandons truth and fails those who desperately need it.</p>

      <h3>The Biblical Balance: Truth and Grace</h3>
      <p>Jesus came "full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). We must hold firmly to biblical truth while extending Christ-like grace and love:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speak truth courageously</strong> - Don't be silent about what God's Word teaches, even when it's unpopular (Acts 4:19-20)</li>
        <li><strong>Speak truth lovingly</strong> - Our manner should reflect Christ's character: "speaking the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15)</li>
        <li><strong>Live truth consistently</strong> - Our lives must back up our words with authentic faith and godly character (Matthew 5:16)</li>
        <li><strong>Extend grace generously</strong> - Remember that we too were once "dead in transgressions" and saved only by grace (Ephesians 2:1-5)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical Ways to Engage</h2>

      <h3>1. In Personal Relationships</h3>
      <p>Build genuine friendships with those who disagree with us. Let them see Christ's love in action before they hear our convictions. When we do speak truth, do so in the context of relationship and genuine care for their well-being.</p>

      <h3>2. In the Public Square</h3>
      <p>Engage thoughtfully in cultural debates, whether through voting, advocacy, writing, or speaking. Make compelling arguments based on reason and natural law, not just biblical authority, while never compromising our commitment to Scripture.</p>

      <h3>3. In the Church</h3>
      <p>Teach biblical truth clearly and comprehensively. Disciple believers to think biblically about cultural issues. Create communities where people experiencing cultural pressure find support, encouragement, and accountability.</p>

      <h3>4. In Our Families</h3>
      <p>Intentionally teach our children biblical truth and train them to engage culture wisely. Don't assume they'll absorb Christian values osmosically - deliberately pass on faith and biblical worldview.</p>

      <h2>Remember the Spiritual Battle</h2>
      <p>Paul's words in Ephesians 6 remind us that our primary weapons are spiritual:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prayer</strong> - Interceding for our culture, leaders, and those deceived by lies</li>
        <li><strong>God's Word</strong> - The "sword of the Spirit" that cuts through deception</li>
        <li><strong>Righteousness</strong> - Living holy lives that adorn our message</li>
        <li><strong>Faith</strong> - Trusting God's sovereignty even when culture seems to be losing</li>
        <li><strong>Truth</strong> - Standing firm on biblical truth regardless of cultural pressure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hope for the Future</h2>
      <p>While cultural trends may seem discouraging, we serve a sovereign God who is never surprised or defeated. History shows that cultural decline can be reversed through spiritual awakening. Our task is to be faithful in our generation:</p>

      <blockquote>"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land" (2 Chronicles 7:14)</blockquote>

      <h2>The Ultimate Victory</h2>
      <p>Regardless of how cultural battles unfold, we know the end of the story. Jesus Christ will return, every knee will bow, and truth will ultimately triumph (Philippians 2:10-11). Our calling is not to win a culture war but to be faithful witnesses to the truth, living and proclaiming the gospel until Christ returns.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The war on culture is real, and Christians cannot remain neutral. But we must engage wisely - standing firmly for truth while extending genuine love, speaking boldly while living humbly, fighting spiritual battles with spiritual weapons while showing grace to those who oppose us.</p>

      <p>Remember: people are not the enemy; they are prisoners of war who need liberation. Our culture is not the enemy; it's a mission field that needs the gospel. Satan is the enemy, and he has already been defeated at the cross.</p>

      <p><em>Let us engage our culture with courage and compassion, truth and grace, conviction and love - pointing people not to political positions but to the Person of Jesus Christ, who alone can transform hearts and heal our land.</em></p>

    pdfUrl: "/articles/richard-four12-global/Is God Genocidal.pdf",
    content: `
      <p>One of the most challenging questions skeptics raise about the Bible concerns God's command to Israel to conquer Canaan and destroy its inhabitants. "How can you worship a God who commanded genocide?" they ask. This is a serious question that deserves a thoughtful, biblical answer.</p>

      <h2>Understanding the Question</h2>
      <p>The concern arises from passages like Deuteronomy 7:1-2: "When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations... then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy."</p>

      <p>Similar commands appear regarding the conquest of Canaan. To modern readers, this can seem incompatible with the God who is love, who sent His Son to save the world. How do we reconcile these texts with the character of God revealed throughout Scripture?</p>

      <h2>Important Distinctions</h2>

      <h3>1. This Was Not Genocide</h3>
      <p>Genocide is the systematic attempt to eliminate an ethnic group simply because of their ethnicity. What God commanded in Canaan was fundamentally different:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It was <strong>not based on ethnicity</strong> but on the moral and spiritual state of the Canaanite nations</li>
        <li>It was <strong>not unprovoked</strong> but a response to centuries of extreme wickedness</li>
        <li>It was <strong>not a pattern</strong> but a unique, specific historical situation</li>
        <li>It <strong>offered mercy</strong> to those who repented (as seen with Rahab and her family)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. This Was Divine Judgment</h3>
      <p>The destruction of Canaan was God's judgment on nations whose wickedness had reached its full measure. Genesis 15:16 reveals God told Abraham his descendants would return to Canaan in the fourth generation, "for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."</p>

      <p>God waited over 400 years, giving the Canaanites time to repent. Their destruction wasn't arbitrary but judicial - God acting as the righteous Judge of all the earth.</p>

      <h2>The Wickedness of Canaan</h2>
      <p>To understand God's judgment, we must understand what the Canaanites were doing. Leviticus 18 and Deuteronomy 18 describe their practices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Child sacrifice</strong> - Burning their own children alive as offerings to gods like Molech</li>
        <li><strong>Temple prostitution</strong> - Both heterosexual and homosexual prostitution as part of religious practice</li>
        <li><strong>Bestiality</strong> - Sexual relations with animals as ritual practice</li>
        <li><strong>Incest and sexual perversion</strong> - Extreme sexual immorality of every kind</li>
        <li><strong>Occult practices</strong> - Divination, sorcery, and spiritism</li>
      </ul>

      <p>God declared: "Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled. Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants" (Leviticus 18:24-25).</p>

      <p>This wasn't about ethnic cleansing but moral judgment on societies that had descended into extreme depravity, including the ritualistic murder of children.</p>

      <h2>God's Character Remains Consistent</h2>

      <h3>God is Just</h3>
      <p>A God who never judged evil would not be good or just. The same God who is "slow to anger, abounding in love" (Psalm 103:8) is also the God who "will not leave the guilty unpunished" (Exodus 34:7).</p>

      <p>Abraham himself asked, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Genesis 18:25). The answer is yes - God's judgments are always righteous, even when we don't fully understand them.</p>

      <h3>God is Patient</h3>
      <p>God waited over 400 years before judging Canaan. His patience gave ample opportunity for repentance. Even then, He showed mercy to individuals like Rahab who turned to Him in faith.</p>

      <h3>God is Merciful</h3>
      <p>Throughout the conquest narratives, we see God's mercy extended to those who repented. Rahab and her family were spared. The Gibeonites, though they used deception, were shown mercy. God's desire has always been that the wicked turn from their ways and live (Ezekiel 33:11).</p>

      <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

      <h3>1. God Has the Right to Judge</h3>
      <p>As the Creator and Sustainer of all life, God alone has the authority to give and take life. We don't. God's commands to Israel were specific, limited in scope, and cannot be used to justify human violence today.</p>

      <h3>2. God Used Israel as an Instrument of Judgment</h3>
      <p>Just as God later used Babylon as an instrument of judgment against Israel (Jeremiah 25:9), He used Israel as an instrument of judgment against Canaan. This doesn't make killing good in itself, but it shows God using human agents to execute His righteous judgments.</p>

      <h3>3. God Also Judged Israel</h3>
      <p>Importantly, God warned Israel that if they committed the same sins as the Canaanites, they would face the same judgment. And when Israel later fell into similar wickedness, God did judge them - using other nations to bring correction and eventually exile.</p>

      <p>This proves the judgment wasn't about favoritism or ethnic preference but about God's absolute holiness and justice.</p>

      <h3>4. The Language Was Partially Hyperbolic</h3>
      <p>Ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts routinely used hyperbolic language. "Total destruction" was a conventional way of describing military victory, not necessarily literal annihilation. Archaeological evidence suggests Canaanites continued to exist after the conquest, which the Bible itself acknowledges (Judges 1).</p>

      <h2>The Ultimate Context: The Cross</h2>
      <p>The most important perspective comes from understanding God's ultimate response to human sin. At the cross, we see:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>God's justice satisfied</strong> - Sin must be punished; at the cross, God didn't overlook sin but bore its penalty Himself</li>
        <li><strong>God's mercy extended</strong> - Rather than destroying all sinners, God provided a way of salvation through Christ</li>
        <li><strong>God's love demonstrated</strong> - "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The same holy God who judged Canaan also sent His Son to die for sinners. This doesn't contradict His character - it fulfills it, showing that God is both perfectly just and perfectly merciful.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for Us</h2>

      <h3>1. Take Sin Seriously</h3>
      <p>The conquest of Canaan reminds us that God takes sin seriously. We live in a culture that dismisses sin as no big deal, but these texts remind us that wickedness has terrible consequences.</p>

      <h3>2. Marvel at God's Patience</h3>
      <p>God's 400-year patience with Canaan should cause us to marvel at His patience with our own generation. "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).</p>

      <h3>3. Trust God's Justice</h3>
      <p>Even when we don't fully understand God's ways, we can trust His character. He is good, just, and merciful. One day we will see clearly what we now see dimly, and we will recognize that all God's judgments are righteous and true (Revelation 16:7).</p>

      <h3>4. Embrace the Gospel</h3>
      <p>The conquest of Canaan shows what we deserve - judgment for our sin. The gospel shows what God offers - mercy through Christ. Let us flee from the wrath to come by running to the Savior who bore God's judgment in our place.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Is God genocidal? No. God is the righteous Judge who, after centuries of patience, brought just judgment on nations whose extreme wickedness included the murder of children and pervasive sexual perversion. He did so using Israel as His instrument, while also warning Israel they would face the same judgment if they fell into the same sins.</p>

      <p>Far from being arbitrary or cruel, God's judgments in Canaan demonstrate His holiness, justice, and patience. And the same God who judged wickedness in Canaan has provided salvation for all wickedness through the cross of Jesus Christ.</p>

      <p><em>Let us not shy away from difficult texts but wrestle with them honestly, trusting that the God who is revealed in Scripture - including these challenging passages - is perfectly good, just, and worthy of our worship. And let us proclaim the gospel that offers mercy to all who will turn from wickedness and trust in Christ.</em></p>

      <p>In a culture obsessed with romantic relationships, singleness is often viewed as a problem to be fixed or a deficit to be remedied. Yet the Bible presents a radically different perspective on singleness - not as a waiting room for "real life" to begin, but as a unique season with distinct opportunities to serve God and others. You may be single, but you are not alone.</p>

      <h2>Biblical Perspective on Singleness</h2>

      <h3>Singleness is a Gift</h3>
      <p>The Apostle Paul wrote, "I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that" (1 Corinthians 7:7). Paul explicitly calls singleness a gift - not a curse, not a problem, not a second-best option, but a gift.</p>

      <p>This doesn't mean singleness is always easy or that single people never desire marriage. It means that singleness, like marriage, is a God-given state that can be used powerfully for His glory.</p>

      <h3>Jesus Was Single</h3>
      <p>The most important person who ever lived - Jesus Christ - was single. His singleness didn't make Him incomplete, inadequate, or unable to fulfill His purpose. In fact, His singleness enabled Him to give Himself fully to His mission without the divided concerns that come with family responsibilities.</p>

      <p>If Jesus could live a full, meaningful, impactful life as a single person, so can we.</p>

      <h3>Paul Valued Singleness</h3>
      <p>Paul went so far as to say, "I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs - how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world - how he can please his wife - and his interests are divided" (1 Corinthians 7:32-34).</p>

      <p>Paul isn't denigrating marriage but highlighting a unique advantage of singleness: the ability to serve God with undivided devotion. Marriage is wonderful, but it necessarily divides our attention and energy. Singleness offers freedom to pursue God and His purposes with singular focus.</p>

      <h2>The Challenges of Singleness</h2>
      <p>Let's be honest: singleness comes with real challenges that shouldn't be minimized:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loneliness</strong> - The desire for companionship and intimacy is God-given and very real</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual temptation</strong> - Living purely in a sex-saturated culture requires constant vigilance</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural pressure</strong> - Society constantly sends messages that you're not complete without a romantic relationship</li>
        <li><strong>Church insensitivity</strong> - Even churches can make singles feel like second-class citizens through overly marriage-focused teaching and programming</li>
        <li><strong>Practical difficulties</strong> - Facing life's challenges alone, making decisions solo, and managing everything independently can be overwhelming</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty about the future</strong> - Not knowing if or when marriage might come can create anxiety</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These challenges are real and valid. Acknowledging them honestly is important for finding healthy ways to navigate singleness.</p>

      <h2>Living Well as a Single Christian</h2>

      <h3>1. Cultivate Contentment</h3>
      <p>Paul wrote, "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances" (Philippians 4:11). Contentment doesn't mean not desiring marriage; it means finding satisfaction in God regardless of your marital status.</p>

      <p>Contentment comes from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognizing that God is sovereign over your life circumstances</li>
        <li>Trusting that God's timing is perfect</li>
        <li>Believing that God's plan for you is good</li>
        <li>Finding your identity and worth in Christ, not in a relationship status</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Invest in Deep Friendships</h3>
      <p>God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone" (Genesis 2:18). While God provided marriage as one answer to this need, deep, godly friendships are another crucial answer - for both single and married people.</p>

      <p>Single Christians should intentionally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build close friendships with other believers</li>
        <li>Create or join community that provides regular fellowship and support</li>
        <li>Develop mentor relationships with older, wiser Christians</li>
        <li>Be vulnerable and authentic in sharing struggles and joys</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Serve God Wholeheartedly</h3>
      <p>Use the advantages of singleness Paul mentioned. Without the responsibilities of spouse and children, you have freedom to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Serve in ministry roles that require significant time and energy</li>
        <li>Take risks for the gospel that would be harder with family obligations</li>
        <li>Be flexible and available for opportunities to serve</li>
        <li>Invest deeply in discipling and mentoring others</li>
        <li>Use your resources generously for kingdom purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't waste your singleness waiting for life to start when marriage comes. Your life has started - use this season purposefully for God's glory.</p>

      <h3>4. Guard Your Heart and Body</h3>
      <p>Sexual purity is God's call for all unmarried believers. This requires intentionality:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Set boundaries for relationships and dating</li>
        <li>Avoid situations that create unnecessary temptation</li>
        <li>Flee sexual immorality in all its forms (1 Corinthians 6:18)</li>
        <li>Fill your mind with truth, not impure content</li>
        <li>Seek accountability with trusted Christian friends</li>
        <li>Remember that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Develop a Vibrant Relationship with God</h3>
      <p>The most important relationship for any person - single or married - is with God. Singleness provides opportunity to develop this relationship deeply without the distractions marriage brings.</p>

      <p>Invest in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular prayer and Scripture reading</li>
        <li>Worship and contemplation</li>
        <li>Solitude and silence to hear God's voice</li>
        <li>Spiritual disciplines that draw you closer to Christ</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Live Fully in the Present</h3>
      <p>Don't put your life on hold waiting for marriage. Pursue your calling, develop your gifts, invest in relationships, serve others, and live purposefully now. God has work for you today, not just in some future married state.</p>

      <h2>For Those Desiring Marriage</h2>
      <p>If you desire marriage, that's not wrong - it's a good desire that God placed in many hearts. Here's how to hold that desire healthily:</p>

      <h3>1. Be Honest with God</h3>
      <p>Like Hannah praying for a child, bring your desire for marriage honestly to God. Don't pretend you don't want something you do want. God knows your heart; pray authentically about your desires.</p>

      <h3>2. Trust God's Timing</h3>
      <p>God's timing is always perfect, even when it doesn't match our timeline. Abraham and Sarah, Moses, David, and many others experienced God's perfect timing in ways they didn't initially understand.</p>

      <h3>3. Prepare for Marriage</h3>
      <p>Use your single years to become the person a godly spouse would want to marry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop godly character</li>
        <li>Address areas of sin and brokenness</li>
        <li>Learn practical life skills</li>
        <li>Grow in emotional and spiritual maturity</li>
        <li>Establish financial stability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Hold Marriage with an Open Hand</h3>
      <p>Desire marriage, but don't idolize it. If marriage becomes your ultimate hope and goal, it's become an idol. Only God can fill the deepest longings of your heart. A spouse cannot complete you - only Christ can.</p>

      <h2>For the Church: Honoring Singles</h2>
      <p>The church needs to better value and include single members:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoid making marriage and family the default topic of sermons and teaching</li>
        <li>Include singles in leadership roles</li>
        <li>Create community structures that don't marginalize singles</li>
        <li>Celebrate singleness as a valid calling, not just a waiting period</li>
        <li>Provide support and connection opportunities for singles</li>
        <li>Stop treating singles as incomplete or second-class Christians</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>You Are Not Alone</h2>
      <p>The title of this article is significant: Single but not alone. Even in singleness, you are not alone because:</p>

      <blockquote>God has promised, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Christ is with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The Holy Spirit lives within you as your Counselor and Companion (John 14:16-17)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>You are part of the body of Christ, surrounded by brothers and sisters (1 Corinthians 12:12-27)</blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Singleness is not a problem to be solved, a disease to be cured, or a waiting room for real life to begin. It's a gift to be stewarded, an opportunity to be seized, and a calling to be fulfilled.</p>

      <p>Whether your singleness lasts a season or a lifetime, use it purposefully for God's glory. Find your completeness in Christ, not in a relationship status. Invest in community, serve wholeheartedly, and trust God's perfect plan for your life.</p>

      <p><em>You may be single, but you are not alone. God is with you, His people surround you, and His purposes await you. Live fully, love deeply, and serve faithfully - right now, in this season, for His glory.</em></p>

      <p>Paul declared, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16). The gospel - the good news of Jesus Christ - is not merely information to be learned or a nice story to be appreciated. It is power - divine power that transforms lives, changes destinies, and alters eternity.</p>

      <h2>What Is the Gospel?</h2>
      <p>Before we can appreciate the gospel's power, we must understand what the gospel is. Paul summarized it in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4:</p>

      <blockquote>"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."</blockquote>

      <p>The gospel is the good news that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>We are sinners</strong> separated from God and deserving judgment (Romans 3:23)</li>
        <li><strong>We cannot save ourselves</strong> through our own efforts or good works (Ephesians 2:8-9)</li>
        <li><strong>Jesus Christ, God's Son, became human</strong> to rescue us (John 1:14)</li>
        <li><strong>He died on the cross</strong> as a substitute, bearing the punishment for our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21)</li>
        <li><strong>He rose from the dead</strong>, conquering sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:54-57)</li>
        <li><strong>He offers forgiveness and eternal life</strong> as a free gift to all who believe (John 3:16)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Power of the Gospel to Save</h2>

      <h3>Power to Forgive Every Sin</h3>
      <p>No sin is too great for the gospel to forgive. The blood of Christ is sufficient to cleanse all sin - past, present, and future. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).</p>

      <p>Murderers like Paul, adulterers like David, deniers like Peter, persecutors, liars, thieves - all have found forgiveness through the gospel. No matter what you've done, Christ's sacrifice is sufficient to cover it.</p>

      <h3>Power to Transform the Heart</h3>
      <p>The gospel doesn't just change our legal standing before God (justification); it transforms our inner nature (sanctification). "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p>

      <p>The gospel's power:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaks the power of sin in our lives</li>
        <li>Gives us new desires and affections</li>
        <li>Transforms our character to become more like Christ</li>
        <li>Empowers us to live holy lives</li>
        <li>Produces spiritual fruit (Galatians 5:22-23)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Power to Reconcile Us to God</h3>
      <p>The gospel bridges the infinite chasm between holy God and sinful humanity. "For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross" (Colossians 1:19-20).</p>

      <p>Through the gospel, we move from being enemies of God to being His beloved children, from being under His wrath to being recipients of His love.</p>

      <h2>The Power of the Gospel to Change Lives</h2>

      <h3>Testimonies Throughout History</h3>
      <p>The power of the gospel has been demonstrated in countless transformed lives throughout history:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Augustine</strong> - From a life of immorality to becoming one of Christianity's greatest theologians</li>
        <li><strong>John Newton</strong> - From slave trader to abolitionist and hymn writer ("Amazing Grace")</li>
        <li><strong>Charles Colson</strong> - From Watergate conspirator to prison ministry pioneer</li>
        <li><strong>Countless addicts</strong> freed from bondage to drugs, alcohol, pornography</li>
        <li><strong>Broken families</strong> restored through forgiveness and renewal</li>
        <li><strong>Hardened criminals</strong> becoming devoted followers of Christ</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Power Over Addiction</h3>
      <p>The gospel breaks chains that human willpower cannot. When the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in a believer, He brings power to overcome what seemed impossible. "You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world" (1 John 4:4).</p>

      <h3>Power Over Fear and Anxiety</h3>
      <p>The gospel assures us that we are loved, forgiven, and secure in Christ. This truth liberates us from crippling fear and anxiety. "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear" (1 John 4:18).</p>

      <h3>Power Over Shame and Guilt</h3>
      <p>The gospel declares that "there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). The burden of shame and guilt that crushes so many is lifted by the truth that Christ has borne our condemnation.</p>

      <h2>The Power of the Gospel to Unite</h2>
      <p>The gospel breaks down barriers that divide humanity:</p>

      <blockquote>"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28)</blockquote>

      <p>In Christ, people from every tribe, tongue, and nation are united as one family. Racial barriers, economic divisions, social hierarchies - all are demolished at the cross where we all stand equal as sinners saved by grace.</p>

      <h2>The Power of the Gospel to Give Hope</h2>

      <h3>Hope for This Life</h3>
      <p>The gospel gives meaning and purpose to our present existence. We're not just drifting through life without direction; we're part of God's grand redemptive plan, given purpose to glorify Him and make Him known.</p>

      <h3>Hope Beyond Death</h3>
      <p>The gospel transforms death from a terrifying end to a glorious transition. Because Christ conquered death through His resurrection, believers have the hope of eternal life. "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Corinthians 15:55).</p>

      <h3>Hope for the Future</h3>
      <p>The gospel assures us that history is moving toward God's predetermined goal - a new heaven and new earth where righteousness dwells, where pain and suffering are no more, where we will see God face to face and experience joy forever.</p>

      <h2>Why the Gospel Has Such Power</h2>

      <h3>It Is God's Chosen Method</h3>
      <p>God has chosen to save people through the "foolishness" of the gospel message (1 Corinthians 1:21). This seemingly weak message carries divine power because God has determined to work through it.</p>

      <h3>It Is Truth</h3>
      <p>The gospel is not a myth, legend, or inspiring fiction. It is historical truth - Jesus really lived, really died, really rose again. Truth has inherent power that lies lack.</p>

      <h3>It Addresses Our Deepest Need</h3>
      <p>Humanity's fundamental problem is not ignorance, poverty, or injustice - it's sin and separation from God. The gospel addresses this root problem, which is why it has power to truly transform.</p>

      <h3>It Comes with the Holy Spirit</h3>
      <p>When the gospel is proclaimed, the Holy Spirit works in hearts to convict, convince, and convert. "When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment" (John 16:8).</p>

      <h2>Our Responsibility</h2>

      <h3>Believe the Gospel</h3>
      <p>The gospel's power is released when we believe it. Not just intellectual assent, but heart trust that rests entirely on Christ for salvation. "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31).</p>

      <h3>Live by the Gospel</h3>
      <p>The gospel isn't just for getting saved; it's for staying saved. We need to preach the gospel to ourselves daily, reminding ourselves of God's grace and letting it shape how we live.</p>

      <h3>Share the Gospel</h3>
      <p>If the gospel has such power, we must share it! Paul asked, "How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" (Romans 10:14).</p>

      <p>We have the privilege and responsibility of being gospel messengers, carrying this powerful message to a world that desperately needs it.</p>

      <h2>Not Ashamed</h2>
      <p>Paul declared he was "not ashamed of the gospel." In a culture that viewed the gospel as foolishness, Paul boldly proclaimed it because he had experienced its transforming power.</p>

      <p>We too should be unashamed of the gospel, regardless of how our culture views it. It is still "the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes."</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The gospel is not a powerless religious message among many others. It is the dynamic power of God unleashed to save, transform, restore, and give hope. It has changed millions of lives throughout history and continues to do so today.</p>

      <p>Have you experienced the gospel's power in your life? If not, today is the day to turn from sin, trust in Christ, and receive the salvation He offers. If you have, are you living in light of its power? Are you sharing its message with others?</p>

      <p><em>The gospel is powerful enough to save the worst sinner, heal the deepest wound, break the strongest addiction, and transform the hardest heart. Thanks be to God for the indescribable gift of the gospel and its power to save!</em></p>

    excerpt: "Discovering the sacred nature of work and how our vocations can glorify God and serve others.",
    image: "/images/articles/IsWorkSacred_Header.jpg",
    pdfUrl: "/articles/richard-four12-global/Is work Sacred.pdf",
    content: `
      <p>Many Christians have a divided view of life: there's "sacred" work (ministry, missions, church activities) and "secular" work (everything else). This division suggests that only certain activities truly matter to God, while the rest of life is spiritually insignificant. But is this biblical? Is work sacred?</p>

      <h2>God is a Worker</h2>
      <p>The Bible's first revelation about God is that He is a worker. Genesis 1 describes God working for six days to create the world. "By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work" (Genesis 2:2).</p>

      <p>Jesus affirmed this: "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working" (John 5:17). God is not idle or inactive - He is constantly working to sustain creation, accomplish His purposes, and care for His people.</p>

      <p>If God works, and we are made in His image, then work is fundamental to our nature and purpose. It's not a result of the fall or a necessary evil - it's part of what it means to be human.</p>

      <h2>Work in the Beginning</h2>
      <p>Before sin entered the world, God gave humanity work to do. "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it" (Genesis 2:15).</p>

      <p>This is crucial: work existed in paradise before the fall. Work itself is not a curse. What the fall did was corrupt work, making it toilsome, frustrating, and often futile (Genesis 3:17-19). But the fundamental goodness of work was established in creation, not undone by the fall.</p>

      <h2>All Work Can Glorify God</h2>
      <p>Paul wrote, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). Note the phrase "whatever you do" - not just "religious" activities but everything we do can glorify God.</p>

      <p>Colossians 3:23 reinforces this: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." This was written to Christian slaves doing manual labor - hardly what we'd call "ministry" - yet Paul says they're working for the Lord.</p>

      <p>This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accountant managing finances glorifies God</li>
        <li>The teacher instructing students glorifies God</li>
        <li>The farmer growing crops glorifies God</li>
        <li>The programmer writing code glorifies God</li>
        <li>The parent raising children glorifies God</li>
        <li>The janitor cleaning buildings glorifies God</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All honest work done in faith and for God's glory is sacred.</p>

      <h2>The Sacred-Secular Divide Is False</h2>
      <p>The notion that only "full-time ministry" is truly sacred work has no biblical support. This unbiblical hierarchy:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Devalues the vast majority of Christians whose calling is in the workplace, not the church office</li>
        <li>Suggests God only cares about a narrow slice of human activity</li>
        <li>Creates guilt in Christians who don't feel "called to ministry"</li>
        <li>Misses the biblical vision of God's reign extending over all of life</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The truth is that all of life is sacred for the Christian. We don't have sacred and secular compartments - we have one life lived entirely for God's glory, whether in the church building or the workplace.</p>

      <h2>Work as Calling</h2>
      <p>Martin Luther recovered the biblical doctrine of vocation - the idea that all legitimate work is a calling from God, not just "religious" work. The farmer plowing his field is as much fulfilling a divine calling as the preacher preparing a sermon.</p>

      <p>This means:</p>

      <h3>1. Your Work Matters to God</h3>
      <p>Whatever your occupation (assuming it's moral and legal), it matters to God. He has placed you there for a purpose. You're not just marking time until you can do "real" ministry - your work is ministry.</p>

      <h3>2. Your Work Serves Others</h3>
      <p>Through work, we love and serve our neighbors. The baker provides bread, the doctor provides healing, the builder provides shelter, the teacher provides knowledge. This service of others is an outworking of the second greatest commandment: love your neighbor (Matthew 22:39).</p>

      <h3>3. Your Work Develops Creation</h3>
      <p>God's command to "fill the earth and subdue it" (Genesis 1:28) - often called the Cultural Mandate - means developing creation's potential. Artists create beauty, scientists discover truth, engineers solve problems, businesspeople create wealth and jobs. This is all part of fulfilling our human calling.</p>

      <h3>4. Your Work Is Worship</h3>
      <p>When done for God's glory, work is an act of worship. We offer our work as a sacrifice of praise to God (Romans 12:1). Excellence in our work honors God; laziness and carelessness dishonor Him.</p>

      <h2>Work as Mission Field</h2>
      <p>Your workplace is your primary mission field. Consider:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You likely spend more waking hours at work than anywhere else</li>
        <li>You have relationships with co-workers who may never enter a church</li>
        <li>Your work provides opportunities to demonstrate Christian character and values</li>
        <li>Your competence and integrity give credibility to your witness</li>
      </ul>

      <p>God hasn't placed you in your job despite it being secular; He's placed you there because it's a strategic position for His kingdom purposes.</p>

      <h2>Working with Excellence</h2>
      <p>If our work glorifies God and serves others, we should pursue excellence:</p>

      <h3>Work Diligently</h3>
      <p>"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart" (Colossians 3:23). Laziness, half-hearted effort, and minimal compliance dishonor God. Christians should be the best employees, not because we're earning salvation, but because we're representing Christ.</p>

      <h3>Work Honestly</h3>
      <p>Integrity in all business dealings is non-negotiable. Cutting corners, fudging numbers, misrepresenting products, or cheating customers are incompatible with Christian faith, regardless of whether "everyone does it."</p>

      <h3>Work Humbly</h3>
      <p>Excellence doesn't mean arrogance. We work well not to glorify ourselves but to glorify God. We serve others, not lord it over them. We acknowledge our gifts come from God.</p>

      <h3>Work Wisely</h3>
      <p>Workaholism isn't godly - it's idolatry. We must maintain proper boundaries, prioritize family and rest, and remember that our identity is in Christ, not our career achievements.</p>

      <h2>When Work Is Frustrating</h2>
      <p>Because of the fall, work is often frustrating, exhausting, and seemingly futile. We face:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Difficult colleagues and demanding bosses</li>
        <li>Monotonous tasks and unrewarding labor</li>
        <li>Injustice and unfair treatment</li>
        <li>Work that seems meaningless or unproductive</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In these times, remember:</p>

      <h3>God Sees Your Labor</h3>
      <p>"The Lord knows those who are his" (2 Timothy 2:19). Your faithful work isn't unnoticed by God, even if unappreciated by people.</p>

      <h3>God Will Reward</h3>
      <p>"The Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do" (Ephesians 6:8). Ultimate recognition comes from God, not employers or colleagues.</p>

      <h3>Work Won't Be Forever</h3>
      <p>In the new creation, we'll serve God without the curse of toilsome, frustrating labor. Our work will be pure joy and fulfillment (Revelation 22:3).</p>

      <h2>Finding Your Calling</h2>
      <p>How do you discern your specific calling? Consider:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gifting</strong> - What has God equipped you to do well?</li>
        <li><strong>Passion</strong> - What work energizes rather than drains you?</li>
        <li><strong>Opportunity</strong> - What doors has God opened for you?</li>
        <li><strong>Need</strong> - Where can you serve others and meet genuine needs?</li>
        <li><strong>Counsel</strong> - What do wise, godly people affirm about your calling?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your calling may change across life seasons. Stay flexible and attentive to God's leading.</p>

      <h2>Work and Eternity</h2>
      <p>Will our work matter in eternity? Yes! Revelation 14:13 says, "their deeds will follow them." Our work contributes to God's kingdom in ways we may not fully understand until eternity.</p>

      <p>Moreover, skills and capacities developed through work may continue in the new creation. We'll reign with Christ and serve Him forever - implying purposeful activity, not idle bliss.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Is work sacred? Absolutely! All honest work done in faith for God's glory is sacred. There's no sacred-secular divide for Christians - all of life is lived coram Deo, before the face of God.</p>

      <p>This transforms how we view Monday morning. We're not leaving sacred time (Sunday) to enter secular time (the workweek). We're continuing to serve God and His purposes, just in a different context.</p>

      <p>Let us honor God through excellent, faithful work. Let us serve others through our vocations. Let us see our workplaces as mission fields. And let us remember that whatever our hand finds to do, we do it for the Lord.</p>

      <p><em>Whether you're a pastor or a plumber, a missionary or a mechanic, a teacher or a technician - work faithfully, work excellently, work joyfully, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain and that you are fulfilling your sacred calling to glorify God in all you do.</em></p>
